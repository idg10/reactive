        // We execute the ManOrBoy_Basics tests twice, once without a SynchronizationContext, and
        // once with one. When we were on xUnit, SynchronizationContext.Current was never null
        // because xUnit populates it with their AsyncTestSyncContext, apparently to ensure that
        // async void tests work. MSTest takes the more strict view that async void tests should
        // not be encouraged. (It has an analyzer to detect these and warn you about them). So
        // tests in MSTest get the default behaviour (i.e. SynchronizationContext.Current will be
        // null) unless the test sets one up explicitly.
        //
        // The ManOrBoy_Basics tests exercise different code paths depending on the availability of
        // a SynchronizationContext. AsyncSubject<T>.AwaitObserver.InvokeOnOriginalContext will go
        // via the context if there is one, and invokes its callback synchronously if not. This is
        // a significant difference, which is why, now that we can test both ways, we do.
        //
        // When we switched to MSTest, and before we had added the tests to run both with and
        // without the SynchronizationContext (meaning we only tested without one) this test
        // started failing intermittently. This seems likely to be indicative of a subtle bug in
        // Rx, because there doesn't seem to be any obvious reason why this should be expected to
        // deadlock in the absence of a synchronization context. It doesn't fail if you run the
        // test in isolation. It only happens when running all the tests, and even then it often
        // doesn't. Since we modified the build to apply a default timeout to all tests with the
        // aim of trying to work out which tests were occasionally locking up, the failures have
        // not yet recurred, suggesting that there's some sort of race condition here that's finely
        // balanced enough to be affected by test settings. Maybe there's some subtle reason why
        // you should never attempt to do what this test is doing without a
        // SynchronizationContext, but if so, it's unclear what that might be.
        // Issue https://github.com/dotnet/reactive/issues/1885 is tracking this until we
        // resolve the root cause of the occasional failures.
